# [Creating Angular Directives][published url]
## Instructor: [Andrew Burgess][instructor url]

AngularJS is one of the most popular front-end JavaScript libraries available right now. If you've  given it a try, you've seen that it has a rather unique take on web applications. Instead of creating text-based templates that you render and append to the DOM, you build a more-or-less regular HTML page, annotating it with Angular directives in order to create a dynamic web application. In this course, we'll learn how to create custom directives.
